# Version 1.0.0 - Boo, the first release!
KASPER is a Karma and Player Evaluation Resource. It was designed to allow Game Masters to easily track players reputations related to NPCs, Factions, Organizations or really anything. Its highly configurable Tiered Ranking system allows you to quickly create and track anything from a players relation to another NPC, to their Rank in individual Factions. If it can be put on a scale from X to Y, than KASPER can track it. 

Here's why you should be using KASPER:
* If you need to track your groups reputation with NPCs, Factions, Organizations or anything else, KASPER can do it.
* If you need to track players ranks in Factions, Organizations or anything else, KASPER can do it.
* If you like Ghosts and want to see a Ghost in your Foundry VTT instance, KASPER can do it.
